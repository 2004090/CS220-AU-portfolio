### Reflection on Digital Identities

Nowadays, we live in a world filled with various types of technology. We use the internet on a daily basis, but how do we know who we are online? Most people may find it difficult to understand, but our digital identities are like our digital footprints on various websites. Furthermore, rather than just conducting research, we can use the internet to share our thoughts with other internet users. When you use various online services, your digital identity can serve as evidence of who you are as an individual.

As nowadays, more and more people are using online systems every single day, digital identities can represent not only people but it can also represent organizations. They are different ranges of ways an individual can engage on the internet. Some are visitors and some residents. The V&R maps were introduced to show how individuals engaged online on different computer systems, and it was based on the Visitors and Residents group activities. The V&R map is a great tool to explore how other individuals use the internet daily. To understand more about this, I explored the concept of David White. According to David White’s idea on Visitors and Residents, it is just a simple way that describes the range of ways individuals can engage with the web. (White, 2011) The concept is also implemented in the V&R map to reflect how we engage in online activities. Every people’s past, present and future digital identities are different. Most of them depend on what type of characteristics they have as an individual. In terms of digital natives and digital immigrants by Marc Prensky, we could see that it can be divided into two generations. (Prensky, 2001) The term digital natives are people born in the technologies and digital era, and people who were born before the digital age were called digital immigrants. The notions of these two terms stated out how we could create our V&R by ourselves, knowing which area we are supposed to be in. 

When I was a kid, I didn't participate in social media, but I spent most of my time on software such as YouTube. Since I was a teenager, I have been in contact with and participating in online events and social media. According to David White, logging in to any online software in guest mode will plan to obtain the required information and resources without leaving any traces. (White, 2011) White's concept is to distinguish between visitors and residents, and declare that they are not two types of boxes, not people. If you go online with a resident mentality, you may live there like many others. You can post your opinions and different opinions online. I see myself more in residential areas, and most of the apps I use will be Instagram, Facebook, TikTok. According to your daily participation on a particular platform, V & R Map can be divided into personal and institutional. Depending on your daily participation on a particular platform, V & R maps can be divided into personal and organizational. Participating in networks and online activities is easy, but the safety of using these platforms is one of the most worrisome. You can decide for yourself which online activities should be personal and institutional to us. To get a clear understanding on how I engage online, I created a V&R map.

The V&R map above that I have created is how I engage online with different platforms daily. It shows how I engage in visitor and resident mode with two various reasons for usage: personal and institutional.

This is my current V&R map, showing how I use and participate in different online activities and platforms. Usage split between individuals and institutions. The personal/resident model is how I usually interact with different types of social media online, and I use these social media every day. As you can see on the V&R map, I put two emails in two different areas, one for individuals/visitors and the other for organizations/visitors. The reason is that the mails in my area are mainly used for entertainment systems, fashion, games, news and daily use mails. But one of the institutions/visitors is the e-mail used by the university, which is mainly the information of the institution, the information of the lecturer, and the data of different departments of the university. Most online platforms for institutions/visitors and residential areas are mainly used for universities. Other online activities and media are used for personal research and personal entertainment.

Since I was a teenager, my digital identities have evolved dramatically. As a teenager, I mostly used online platforms for academic research, with YouTube serving as my only source of entertainment. In the past, my digital identities were primarily formed by spending time online playing games and watching various YouTube videos. As I got older, I spent more time online researching for school. At the same time, I would spend time on various entertainment platforms such as Netflix and YouTube, as well as social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. My future digital identity objectives will be to explore more online platforms within the institutional area and to try to explore more platforms to add to my V&R map.
