### Reflection on Digital Identities

Nowadays, we live in a world filled with various types of technology. We use the internet on a daily basis, but how do we know who we are online? Most people may find it difficult to understand, but our digital identities are like our digital footprints on various websites. Furthermore, rather than just conducting research, we can use the internet to share our thoughts with other internet users. When you use various online services, your digital identity can serve as evidence of who you are as an individual.

As nowadays, more and more people are using online systems every single day, digital identities can represent not only people but it can also represent organizations. They are different ranges of ways an individual can engage on the internet. Some are visitors and some residents. The V&R maps were introduced to show how individuals engaged online on different computer systems, and it was based on the Visitors and Residents group activities. The V&R map is a great tool to explore how other individuals use the internet daily. To understand more about this, I explored the concept of David White. According to David White’s idea on Visitors and Residents, it is just a simple way that describes the range of ways individuals can engage with the web. (White, 2011) The concept is also implemented in the V&R map to reflect how we engage in online activities. Every people’s past, present and future digital identities are different. Most of them depend on what type of characteristics they have as an individual. In terms of digital natives and digital immigrants by Marc Prensky, we could see that it can be divided into two generations. (Prensky, 2001) The term digital natives are people born in the technologies and digital era, and people who were born before the digital age were called digital immigrants. The notions of these two terms stated out how we could create our V&R by ourselves, knowing which area we are supposed to be in. 

When I was a kid, I wasn't involved in social media, but most of the time I was spending time on software such as YouTube. Since I was a teenager, I started to stay in touch with and get involved with online activities and social media. According to David White, logging in to any of the online software in visitor mode plans to get the information and resources you need without leaving a trace. (White, 2011) White's concept is to distinguish between visitors and residents and state that they are not two categories of boxes, not people. And if you go online with a resident mindset, you probably live there like many other individuals. You can express your opinions and different perspectives online. I see myself more in the resident area, and most of the applications I've used will be Instagram, Facebook, TikTok. Depending on your daily engagement on a particular platform, V & R maps can be divided into personal and organizational. According to your daily participation on certain platforms, the V&R map can be divided into personal and institutional. Although it is easy to participate in network and online activities, the safety of using these platforms is one of the things to worry about most. We can decide for ourselves which online activities should be personal and institutional for us.
Getting to know how we should list our engagement online, I created a V&R map showing how I used online systems and specific platforms daily. 

Figure 1:

The V&R map above that I have created is how I engage online with different platforms daily. It shows how I engage in visitor and resident mode with two various reasons for usage: personal and institutional.

This is my current V&R map, which shows how I use and engage in different online activities and platforms. The usage between personal and institutional are divided equally. Around the personal/resident mode is how I usually engage online with varying types of social media, which I often use daily. As you can see on the V&R map, I put two emails in two different areas, one in personal/visitor and one in institutional/visitor. The reason for this is that the email in my area is mainly used for emails from entertainment systems, fashions, games, news, and daily usages. But the one in the institutional/visitor is the email used for university, which is primarily institutional information, information from lecturers and data from different departments in the university. Most of the online platforms in the institutional/visitor and resident area are mainly used for the university. And other online activities and media are used for personal research and personal entertainment. 

Since I was a teenager, my digital identities have evolved dramatically. As a teenager, I mostly used online platforms for academic research, with YouTube serving as my only source of entertainment. In the past, my digital identities were primarily formed by spending time online playing games and watching various YouTube videos. As I got older, I spent more time online researching for school. At the same time, I would spend time on various entertainment platforms such as Netflix and YouTube, as well as social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok. My future digital identity objectives will be to explore more online platforms within the institutional area and to try to explore more platforms to add to my V&R map. 







### Thoughts
- maybe also have the two maps next to each other for easy comparison
