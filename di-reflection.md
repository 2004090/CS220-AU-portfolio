Nowadays, we are currently living in a world with different kinds of technologies. We use the internet every day on our daily basis, but how can we identify our digital identities? It might be a difficult question for most of the people, but digital identities are like our footprints within different websites. We can do many different things on the internet, and we can also use it in different ways. Rather than using the internet only for researching, we can use it to exchange opinions with other internet users. As a matter of fact, digital identities can be the evidence showing who you are as an individual on the internet, when you are using various services online. Digital identities can also provide security while using systems online. 

As nowadays, more and more people are using online systems every single day, digital identities can represent not only people, but it can also represent organizations. They are different range of ways an individual can engage on the internet. Some are visitors and some residents. The V&R maps were introduced to show how individuals engaged online on different computer systems, and it was based on the Visitors and Residents group activities. The V&R map is a very great tool to explore how different individuals are using the internet on their daily basis. To be able to understand more about this, I explored the concept of David White. According to David White’s concept on Visitors and Residents, it is just a simple way that describe the range of ways individuals can engage with the web. (White, 2011) The concept is also implementing in the V&R map to reflect how we engage in online activities. Every people’s past, present and future digital identities are different. Most of them are depending on what type of characteristics they have as an individual. In terms of digital natives and digital immigrants by Marc Prensky, we could see that it can be divided into two generations. (Prensky, 2001) The term digital natives are people born in the technologies and digital era, and people who were born before the digital era were called digital immigrants. The notions of these two terms stated out how we could create our V&R by ourselves knowing which area we are supposed to be in. 

For me as a child, I did not really engage on social media, but I would mostly spend my time on software such as YouTube. I started to be in touch and engage with online activities and social medias when I was a teenager. According to David White, if you are log in on any of the online software as visitors’ mode, you are planning to get the information and resources you need without leaving any traces. (White, 2011) The concept of White is that he distinguishes the differences between Visitors and Residents and stated that they are not two boxes of categories, and they are not people. And if you are going online with a resident mindset, you are probably going to live a life out there like many other individuals. You manage to express opinions and different perspectives online. I see myself more in the area of residents, and most of applications I used would be Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.  The V&R map can be divided into personal and institutional, depending on your daily engagement on certain platforms. Although the web and online activities are easy to get involve in, but the security on using these platforms are one of the most important things to be worried about. We can decide on our own that which online activities should be personal and institutional for us, and we should make sure that if we are going online on which mindset, Visitors or Residents. 

Getting to know how we should list out our engagement online, I have created a V&R map showing how I used online systems and certain platforms daily. 

Figure 1:

The V&R map above that I have created is how I engage online with different platforms daily. It shows how I engage in visitor and resident mode with two different reasons of usage which are personal and institutional.

This is my current V&R map which shows that how I use and engage in different online activities and platforms. The usage between personal and institutional are divided equally. Around the personal/resident mode is how I usually engage online with different types of social medias, which I often used them daily.  As you can see on the V&R map that I put two emails in two different areas, one in personal/visitor and one in institutional/visitor. The reason for this is that the email in my personal area is mostly used for emails from entertainment systems, fashions, games, news, and daily usages. But the one in the institutional/visitor is the email used for university. Which is mostly institutional information, information from lecturers and information from different departments in the university. Most of the online platforms in the institutional/visitor and resident area are mostly used for the university. And other online activities and platforms are used for personal research and personal entertainment. 

The digital identities of mine has changed greatly since I was a teenager. As a teenager, I mostly used online platforms for academic research and the only entertainment activity would be using YouTube. My digital identities in the past were mostly spending time online with games and different videos on YouTube. As I grow older, I spent more time online researching for academic purposes and at the same I would also spend some time on different entertainment platforms such as Netflix and YouTube and social media such as Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. My objectives for my future digital identities will be to explore more online platforms within the institutional area and try to explore more platforms to put in my V&R map. Furthermore, I will try to list out more interesting apps and make a professionally build V&R map. 




### Questions you should/could export 
- do I know people who are much older than me and can use technology efficiently e.g. the Web more efficiently?
- what does it actually mean "to use the Web more efficiently"?
- what's the difference between White et al.'s and Prensky's idea regarding people engaging with technology?
- on the V&R map, what's the fundamental difference between 'visitor' modes and 'resident' modes and what does the 'personal on institutional' dimension provide?
- how have I been using digital technology in different contexts i.e. how has my 'digital journey' changed since my first device e.g. the one given to me by parents?
- how can/should I (or shouldn't) link my personal identities to my professional identities?
- what implications do my visitor identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my personal identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my personal life?
- what implications do my resident identities have on my professional/institutional life?
- how do I assess the credibility of information of other people (or institutions) e.g. does it matter how good their profile picture looks or how well their website is designed? 
- how much fact-checking could people do when visiting my resident identities e.g. my websites or social accounts and who much fact-checking do I need to do when referencing others' work?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with how high the information ranks using a search engine?
- is a piece of information's creditably in line with the creditability (or the number of followers) of a mainstream or alternative broadcaster, its references and perhaps who it was reviewed by? Can this information be biased or could there be a conflict of interest? 
- what does it mean to critically evaluate information i.e. what is critical thinking?
- how do I develop my critical thinking regarding my engagement on the Web in my visitor and resident modes?
- what is my digital capability e.g. what aspect of technology am I comfortable/uncomfortable with?
- how can I improve my online presence e.g. by monitoring the time I spend on social media vs. work when using my computing device?
- how can I improve the way I interact with information online e.g. can I access a more mindful/objective instead of a more reactive/emotional/biased state of mind before sharing or commenting on something online?
- what information about my developing digital identities am I confident sharing publicly?

### Thoughts
- maybe also have the two maps next to each other for easy comparison
